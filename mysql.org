* allow root remote connections to mysql?

root remote access is disabled by default.

#+begin_src
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
#+end_src

and then find my.cnf(linux /etc/mysql/my.cnf) or my.ini(windows C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.5\).

Change line

 bind-address = 127.0.0.1

to

 #bind-address = 127.0.0.1
