<ul>
<li>walking through code with debugger for understanding code.</li>
</ul>

<p>So basically anytime I do
something clever, I make sure I have a test in there to break really loudly</p>

<p>It’s one thing to go2
learn a language for fun, but until you write some big, complex system in it,
you don’t really learn it.</p>

<p>Seibel: How do you design software?
Fitzpatrick: I start with interfaces between things. What are the common
methods, or the common RPCs, or the common queries. If it’s storage, I try
to think, what are the common queries? What indexes do we need? How
are the data going to be laid out on disk? Then I write dummy mocks for
different parts and flesh it out over time.
Seibel: Do you write mocks in the test-first sense so you can test it as you
go?</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick: More and more. I always designed software this way, even
before testing. I would just design interfaces and storage first, and then
work up to an actual implementation later.
Seibel: What form would the design take? Pseudocode? Actual code?
Whiteboard scribbles?</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick: Generally I would bring up an editor and just write notes with
pseudocode for the schema. After it got good, I would make up a real
schema and then I would copy-paste it in just to make sure that “create
table” works. Once I got that all going, I’d actually go implement it. I always
start with a spec.txt first.</p>

<p>Seibel: Do you have any advice for self-taught programmers?
Fitzpatrick: Always try to do something a little harder, that’s outside your
reach. Read code. I heard this a lot, but it didn’t really sink in until later.</p>

<p>Seibel: What are your debugging tools? Debuggers? Printlns? Something
else?
Fitzpatrick: Println if I’m in an environment where I can do that.
Debugger, if I’m in an environment that has good debuggers. GDB is really
well maintained at Google and is kind of irreplaceable when you need it. I
try not to need it too often. I’m not that great at it, but I can look around
and kind of figure things out generally. If I have to go in there, I generally can
find my way out. I love strace. Strace, I don’t think I could live without. If I
don’t know what some program is doing, or what my program is doing, I
run it under strace and see exactly what’s happening. If I could only have
one tool, it would probably be that. All the Valgrind tools, Callgrind and all
that, those are good.</p>

<p>But a lot of times lately, if there’s something weird going on, I’m like, “OK,
that function is too big; let’s break that up into smaller parts and unit-test
each one of them separately to figure out where my assumptions are wrong,
rather than just sticking in random printlns.”
Then maybe in the process of refactoring, I have to think about the code
more, and then it becomes obvious. I could, at that point, go back to the
big, ugly state where it was one big function and fix it but I’m already
halfway there; I might as well continue making it simpler for the next
maintainer.</p>

<p>Seibel: How do you use invariants in your code? Some people throw in ad
hoc asserts and some people put in invariants at every step so they can
prove formal properties of their programs, and there’s a big range in the
middle.</p>

<p>Fitzpatrick: I don’t go all the way to formal. My basic rules is, if it could
possibly come from the end user, it’s not a run-time crash. But if it is my
code to my code, I crash it as hard as possible—fail as early as possible.
I try to think mostly in terms of preconditions, and checking things in the
constructor and the beginning of a function. Debug checks, if possible, so it
compiles away. There are probably a lot of schools of thought and I’m
probably not educated about what the proper way to do it is. There are
languages where all this stuff is actually a formal part of the language. Pretty
much all the languages I write in, it’s up to you.</p>

<p>Seibel: What do you think is the most important skill for a programmer to
have?
Fitzpatrick: Thinking like a scientist; changing one thing at a time. Patience
and trying to understand the root cause of things. Especially when you’re
debugging something or designing something that’s not quite working. I’ve
seen young programmers say, “Oh, shit, it doesn’t work,” and then rewrite
it all. Stop. Try to figure out what’s going on. Learn how to write things
incrementally so that at each stage you could verify it.</p>

<p>===============================================================================
Douglas Crockford</p>

<p>Seibel: What makes code readable for you?
Crockford: It happens at a number of levels. The simplest is just being
consistent in the presentation so you always indent everything properly; you
have white space in all the right places. One habit that I still struggle with,
something I learned back in the Fortran days, is I tend to use too many one-
letter variable names, which I believe is a bad thing. And I’m trying really
hard to break it, but it’s difficult—it’s still something I struggle with.</p>

<p>Seibel: What are the concrete things that programmers should focus on to
make their code readable?
Crockford: The subset idea is really important, especially for JavaScript
because it contains so many bad features. But it’s true for all languages.
When I was a journeyman, I would read the language manual and I would
understand every feature. And I would figure out how to use them all. And
I’d use them all all the time. It turns out a lot of them were not well thought
through.
I’m thinking back to Fortran now, but it was true in all languages. Sometimes
language designers get it wrong. C has a whole bunch of errors in it, from
my perspective now.</p>

<p>Seibel: For instance?
Crockford: Like the switch statement having fall-through be the default
was wrong—they shouldn’t have done that. ++ has huge security
problems—it encourages you to be way too tricky, to try to do too much in</p>

<p>one line. In that compulsion to do it in one line, you make code which is
hard to understand and which is likely to lead to things like buffer overrun
errors. So most of the security problems that we’ve seen in operating
systems over the last few years are a consequence of ++ .
In my programming style now I don’t use ++ anymore, ever. I can make the
case that it’s good to use it here and it’s bad to use it there but it’s hard for
me to find the good pieces and the bad pieces in my code.
Seibel: Couldn’t one argue that the security problem with ++ really has
nothing to do with ++ but with unchecked array bounds or raw pointers? It
isn’t a security risk in Java because if you ++ off the end of the array you just
get an exception.</p>

<p>Crockford: Yeah, it’s certainly less dangerous in Java. And that danger
doesn’t exist at all in JavaScript because it doesn’t have arrays. But even so, I
found that the quality of my code got better when I stopped doing it, just
because it invited me to write one-liners and that’s usually a bad idea.
Another example of that is the continue statement. I have never seen a
piece of code that I could not improved by taking the continue out. It
makes certain kinds of complicated structures easier to write. But I found
that I can always improve the structure if I can find a way to factor it out. So
as part of my personal discipline, I don’t use continue ever. If I see a
continue in my code, then I assume I haven’t thought it through carefully.</p>

<p>Seibel: How do you read code you didn’t write?
Crockford: By cleaning it. I’ll throw it in a text editor and I’ll start fixing it.
First thing I’ll do is make the punctuation conform; get the indentation right;
do all that stuff. I have programs that can do that for me, but I find doing
that myself is more efficient in the long run because it gets me more
acquainted with the code. Morningstar taught me to do this. He’s brilliant at
refactoring other people’s code and that’s the approach he takes and I find it
works.</p>

<p>Crockford: I’ve never actually seen that. I think it’s really difficult to write
good code in a sloppy manner. By good code, I mean it’s going to be
readable. At one level, it doesn’t matter what it does to a machine if I can’t
figure out what it does, so it might turn out that the code is amazing in
terms of its efficiency, or its compactness, or some other metric which I
don’t care about.</p>

<p>Readability of code is now my first priority. It’s more important than being
fast, almost as important as being correct, but I think being readable is
actually the most likely way of making it correct.So I think it’s probably not
good code and they probably made the wrong trade-offs if the code turned
out to be in the state that it’s not easily readable.</p>

<p>Seibel: Do you have any advice for self-taught programmers?</p>

<p>Crockford: Yeah, read a lot. There are good books out there. Find the
good ones and read those. And if you’re doing web development, find the
best sites and look at their code. Although I’m a little reluctant to give that
advice yet. Most web developers learned to do web development by doing
“view source,” and until fairly recently, most of the source that was out
there was very bad. So you had a generation of programmers who were
raised on really bad examples, thinking bad code was the way to write.
That’s getting better now, but there’s still so much bad stuff out there that</p>

<h1>I’m reluctant to give that advice yet.</h1>
