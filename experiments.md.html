<ul>
<li>14:56 PM      injection</li>
<li>15:07         drinking the green tea</li>
<li>15:21         I feel a heavier head(but nice), and a little more focused and motivated.</li>
<li>15:42         Energy levels fluctuated to the lower bounds. Feel a little rush towards the upper bound now and then.</li>
<li>16:10         Energy and motivation levels at the lower bound for sure. But still I have the focus.</li>
<li>16:36         The initial effects are gone. But my mind is clear.</li>

<h3>remarks</h3>

<p>I didn't feel the down for sleepiness that I usually get from fish oil.</p>

<h3>remarks</h3>

<p>It didn't have the same effects like the last time. Maybe because the piracetam dose was 
was lower.</p>

<h1>Intranasal insulin</h1>

<p>Bought a regular insulin. it is stated on the product it contains 10ML(each ML contains 100IU).
Each puff is supposed to deliver 10IU.</p>

<p>I calculated ML/puff. 10ML in the canister gives one hundred puffs. which equals 10IU/puff.</p>
