ginsana		x 1
greentea	x 1 cup

* 14:56 PM 		injection
* 15:07			drinking the green tea
* 15:21			I feel a heavier head(but nice), and a little more focused and motivated.
* 15:42			Energy levels fluctuated to the lower bounds. Feel a little rush towards the upper bound now and then.
* 16:10			Energy and motivation levels at the lower bound for sure. But still I have the focus.
* 16:36			The initial effects are gone. But my mind is clear.

### remarks

I didn't feel the down for sleepiness that I usually get from fish oil.

It didn't have the same effects like the last time. Maybe because the piracetam dose was 
was lower.
