* 14:56 PM 		injection
* 15:07			drinking the green tea
* 15:21			I feel a heavier head(but nice), and a little more focused and motivated.
* 15:42			Energy levels fluctuated to the lower bounds. Feel a little rush towards the upper bound now and then.
* 16:10			Energy and motivation levels at the lower bound for sure. But still I have the focus.
* 16:36			The initial effects are gone. But my mind is clear.

### remarks

I didn't feel the down for sleepiness that I usually get from fish oil.

piracetam		x 400
omega3			x 2000
calcium+d3		x 1
biotin			x 1
ginsana			x 1
vitamin			x 400

* 14:23			Injection
* 15:12			I feel sleepy
* 17:10			Not sleepy anymore.

### remarks

It didn't have the same effects like the last time. Maybe because the piracetam dose was 
was lower.


Intranasal insulin
====

Bought a regular insulin. it is stated on the product it contains 10ML(each ML contains 100IU).
Each puff is supposed to deliver 10IU.

I calculated ML/puff. 10ML in the canister gives one hundred puffs. which equals 10IU/puff.

* 3-dec-2016
	* 2 pufs one in morning and afternood
	* Had  a little headache in the afternood when used it with a cup of coffee.

* 4-dec-2016
	* 2 pufs one in morning and afternoon

* 5-dec-2016
	* 2 pufs

* 6-dec-2016
	* 1 puf

* Thu Dec  8 17:17:31 IRST 2016
	* 1 puf

### remarks

This shouldn't be taken with coffee. Coffee should be used 30 to 60 minutes after the initial injection.
