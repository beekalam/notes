This one goes out to the man who minds the miracles
This one goes out the ones in need
This one goes out the sinner and the cynical
This ain't about no apology
This road was paved by the hopeless and the hungry
This road was paved by the winds of change
Walking beside the guilty and the innocent
How will you raise your hand when the call your name?

Yea, Yea, Yea,
We Weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that's a saints and sinners pleas
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say
Yea, Yea, Yea, ooooohhh,, Yea

This ones about anyone who does it differently
This ones about the one who cusses and spits
This ain't about our living in a fantasy
This ain't about giving up or giving in

Yea, Yea, Yea,
We Weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that's a saints and sinners pleas
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say
Yea, Yea, Yea, ooooohhh,, Yea

Let me hear you say
Yea, Yea, Yea, oooohhhhh, Yea

Yea, Yea, Yea,
We Weren't born to follow
Come on and get up off your knees
When life is a bitter pill to swallow
You gotta hold on to what you believe
Believe that the sun will shine tomorrow
And that's a saints and sinners pleas
We weren't born to follow
You gotta stand up for what you believe
Let me hear you say
Yea, Yea, Yea, ooooohhh,, Yea
